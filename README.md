Simon Game Challenge
Welcome to the Simon Game Challenge repository! This project is an implementation of the classic Simon game, a memory-based pattern matching game. The challenge is to build or enhance the Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(jQuery) with a focus on interactivity, design, and functionality.

Features:
User Interaction: Implement the game's core functionality, allowing users to play by clicking on colored buttons or using keyboard inputs.

Audio Feedback: Integrate sound effects to provide audio feedback when buttons are clicked or sequences are played.

Dynamic UI: Create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The UI should adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

Game Logic: Develop the logic for generating and displaying random patterns, as well as handling user input and verifying correctness.

Levels: Implement a level system that increases difficulty as the player progresses.

Getting Started:
Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to play the game.
Dive into the game.js file to explore and modify the game logic.
Customize the styles in the styles.css file to enhance the visual appeal.
